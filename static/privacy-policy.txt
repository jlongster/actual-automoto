1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

Personal information you disclose to us

In short: we don't collect any personal information. The only information stored is an OAuth token which provides access to various google services. We use data from your google accounts and provide various push notification services.

In addition, this service is _not_ meant to be used publicly. If you are not James Long, you should not be using this service. This is only meant to be used by James for his personal edification.

2. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?

In short: We don't share your information with anyone.

3. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

In short: We don't use any cookies or tracking. This is only meant to be used by James so all data specific to James' user is hardcoded in the service.

4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

In short: We keep OAuth tokens as long as they are valid.

5. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

In short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Website, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependentâ€™s use of the Website. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at longster@gmail.com.

6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

In short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.

7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

8. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?

In short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.

We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
